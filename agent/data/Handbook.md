**"Dedicated to Excellence” Franklin R. Narducci, Superintendent**

Dear Parent and Legal Guardian,

We hope this handbook will be helpful to you as we start the 2024-25 school year. The purpose of this handbook is to
provide some general information to assist you throughout the school year. Each school will share more specific
information with you. We also recommend you visit our district’s website, [http://www.cusd80.com,](http://www.cusd80.com,) for regular updates and
current news within our district.

**Please ensure that you and your child read and discuss the following Elementary Handbook. After you’ve read
through these documents with your child, we ask that you complete the next page and return it to the school as
indicated.**

Finally, we believe it is important that you are informed of your parental rights, so we encourage you to read pages 83-
regarding FERPA (Family Education Right to Privacy Act), Directory Information, PPRA (Protection of Pupil Rights Act)
on page 85 and the Student Confinement: Parental Notification and Consent on page 86.

The start of a new school year is so exciting. We thank you for the opportunity to work with your children and hope they
will have a wonderful, productive year filled with lots of learning and excitement. The strongest indicator in the overall
success of our students will always be our ability to work in collaboration with our parents. We hope you feel welcome in
our schools and take advantage of opportunities to become involved, to learn more about our great school district, and to
stay informed of your child’s progress and academic needs on a continuing basis through the Infinite Campus Parent
Portal. Thank you for choosing Chandler Unified School District.

Sincerely,

# Governing Board

Serving on a school district governing board is a rewarding job with enormous responsibility. Governing board members are elected,
unpaid volunteers who have a passion for the public education system, are willing to invest a large amount of time and energy, and
are committed to providing the best education for our students.

Successful board members possess a sincere desire to serve the community, communicate and collaborate effectively with others,
and demonstrate respect for diverse perspectives. They attend board meetings and engage in related board work, bringing their
experience to bear while also striving to become knowledgeable on a multitude of complex matters involving policies, finance and
curriculum. Effective school governing boards work hard to cultivate positive relationships among all stakeholders and plan wisely
to shape the future.

The Board generally holds a “formal” meeting at 7:00 p.m. on Wednesdays once or twice a month to take official action on items on
the agenda. Although the formal agenda is subject to change, all changes to the agenda will be available at least 24 hours prior to
the meeting. Visit the Governing Board page or call the Superintendent’s office at 480-812-7600 to confirm the date of the next
meeting.

## ACADEMICS

### Conferences

Parent conferences are held two times a year. However, as the school year progresses, if you have any problems,
concerns, or questions, please contact your child’s teacher and/or the principal for assistance. All of us are interested and
concerned with your child’s progress and well-being. We pledge our support for your child’s success in school and our
goal is open communication.

Preschool conferences will include the sharing of portfolios of student work and the developmental progress of observed
behaviors. Priority Preschool families meet during IEP meetings and receive quarterly progress notes. If families would
like additional time to meet with the teacher, they may request a conference.

### English Language Development (ELD)

School Board Policy | 5-

Chandler Unified School District implements English Language Development (ELD) models that are approved by the
Arizona Department of Education and support our students’ needs at each elementary school. ELD learners are required
to have a minimum time of instruction for English Language Development. For kindergarten through 5th grade: 120 minutes
per day, 600 minutes per week, or 360 hours per school year. For 6th grade through 12th grade: 100 minutes per day, 600
minutes per week, or 300 hours per school year.

The Arizona English Language Learner Assessment (AZELLA) is used to determine the English language proficiency of
Arizona K-12 students whose primary home language is other than English.

Our current models are based on the number of ELD learners at a given school site. Model One is a pull-out or push-in
approach for schools that have few ELD learners. A highly qualified ELD support teacher works closely with the regular
classroom teacher and both provide instruction in the areas of reading, writing, grammar, vocabulary and oral language
development during the regular school day. The ELD support teacher may service the ELD learners between two to four
hours each day. Model Two is a self-contained approach for schools that have many ELD learners. The students are
grouped by their grade level and their English language level. They’re assigned to a highly qualified ELD classroom teacher
who services the ELD learners by providing instruction in the areas of reading, writing, grammar, vocabulary and oral
language development during the regular school day. We have asked the State Board of Education for an alternative model
that we feel to be more effective. As of the printing of this handbook the proposal is under review. Adjustments to
classrooms may be made at the start of the 2024-25 school year.

### Food Delivery Services

(Door Dash, Grub Hub, Uber Eats, etc.)

We do not allow or accept food delivery orders of any kind at any time of the day. Students and/or parents may not order
food delivery to be dropped off at school. The front office will not accept orders and will refuse delivery.


### Grade Reports

School Board Policy | 5-

In order to assure that parents are well informed of student progress, grades are available to parents in “real-time” through
the Parent Portal. In an effort to go paperless, CUSD will make Grade Reports available to parents at the end of each nine
week grading period. You are able to print a paper copy of the report through your Infinite Campus Parent Portal. If you
need assistance or a paper copy you may also contact your child’s school to assist. **Parents may check the academic
progress of their child at any time during the school year using the Infinite Campus parent portal. Each parent is
encouraged to activate their account at the start of the school year.**

The elementary district grading scale is based on the following percentage scale:
90 – 100 ......................... A (Outstanding)
80 – 89 ........................... B (Very Good)
70 – 79 ........................... C (Satisfactory)
60 – 69 ........................... D (Having Difficulty)
Below 60 ........................ F (Serious Difficulty)

M-----Meets Standards
P------Progressing
AC---Area of Concern

### Homebound Instruction

School Board Policy | 5-

The district provides academic tutoring for students eligible for homebound services in the home by a certified teacher. To
be eligible, a physician must certify that a student will be absent for three months due to a medical condition. These three
months do not have to be consecutive. Forms are available through the office of Pupil Personnel at 480-812-7560.

### Homeless Students

School Board Policies | 5-102 and 5-102A

**Notice of Student Rights under the “McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act”**

This federal legislation guarantees homeless children and youth the following:

```
 The right to immediate enrollment in school, even if lacking paperwork normally required for enrollment.
 The right to attend school in his/her school of origin (if this is requested by the parent or unaccompanied children
and youth and is feasible) or in the school in the attendance area where the family or youth is currently residing.
 The right to receive transportation to his/her school of origin, if this is requested by the parent or unaccompanied
children and youth.
 The right to services comparable to those received by housed schoolmates, including transportation and
supplemental educational services.
```

```
 The right to attend school along with children not experiencing homelessness. Segregation based on a student’s
status as homeless is strictly prohibited.
 The posting of homeless students’ rights in all schools and other places around the community.
```
The term “homeless children and youths”—
A. means individuals who lack a fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence and includes:

```
 Children and youths who are sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing, economic hardship or a
similar reason; are living in motels, hotels, trailer parks, or camping grounds due to the lack of alternative adequate
accommodations; are living in emergency or transitional shelters; are abandoned in hospitals; or are awaiting formal
care placement.
 Children and youths who have a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not designed for
ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human being.
 Children and youths who are living in cars, parks, public spaces or abandoned buildings; substandard housing, bus
or train stations, or similar settings.
 Migratory children who qualify as homeless because the children are living in circumstances described above.
```
### Homework

Homework is an important part of your child’s education. Our district recommends that homework be given to all students
at each grade level. Schools do their best job of educating your child when they have you, the parents/legal guardians as
partners. Homework provides a significant opportunity for you to show your interest and to give your support.

### Homework Assignments

Homework assignments are not included in a student’s achievement grade but are considered opportunities for students to
practice, review and apply knowledge. Homework enhances a student’s ability to reach a level of expected proficiency for
knowledge and skill acquisition appropriate to the student’s instructional level. Homework effort will be indicated on the
Grade Report under: Behaviors that promote learning. Homework beginning in the classroom and assigned to be completed
at home may be graded based on appropriate instruction and feedback. Factors that may be considered in grading of
homework include:

```
 Understanding the assignments before leaving school.
 Completing all assignments accurately.
 Turning in all assignments by the due date.
 Asking the teacher for assistance if unable to accurately complete homework assignments.
```
Our district guidelines suggest minimum and maximum amounts of homework. The amount of daily homework varies from
10 minutes (Kindergarten) to 50 minutes (6th grade).


The following are suggested for homework:
Kindergarten .................. 10 – 15 minutes
Grades 1 and 2 ............. 10 – 25 minutes
Grades 3 and 4 .............. 20 – 30 minutes
Grades 5 and 6 .............. 30 – 50 minutes
Minimal homework may be assigned over weekends or before a holiday.

### Honor Roll (Grades 4-6)

To recognize and promote academic excellence at the elementary level, honor rolls have been established at each school.
To be eligible, a student must have a “B” average. Students are informed of the honor roll system and carefully instructed
to ensure an understanding of the specific goals and methods of computing the honor roll formula.

### Kindergarten Screening

Prior to the start of the school year, Kindergarten students may be given the Kindergarten Individual Screening Test (KIST).
The purpose of the test is to assess the student’s knowledge. The results assist the classroom teachers in planning lessons
and activities for your child’s individual needs. Sites also utilize the results to balance classroom rosters.

### Make-up Work

Students who are absent will be required to make-up work in class. It is the responsibility of the student to obtain all make-
up work. The following guidelines have been established for such work:
 For each day missed, the student has an equal number of days to make-up. Failure to do so may result in a failing
grade or no credit.
 In cases involving an extended illness of more than three days, parents should arrange with the school to have
work picked up for the student.

**Work must be requested 24 hours in advance of pick-up.**


### Off-Campus Jurisdiction

School Board Policy | 5-

The Superintendent will establish regulations governing the conduct of students in school, traveling to and from school, at
school functions, and while off campus and during non-school hours if a student engages in alleged conduct that would
cause continued attendance in school to be detrimental to the school environment. In establishing these regulations,
students are expected to obey all rules and regulations adopted by the Governing Board, and to obey any order given by a
member of the faculty or staff relating to school activities or the school environment.

It is becoming increasingly popular for students to post material on websites such as Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook
or to communicate via email, test or voicemail. Off campus conduct during non-school hours could cause disruption of the
educational environment. Disruption of the educational environment may subject a student to disciplinary action.

### Physical Education

Physical education (PE) for grades kindergarten through six shall be a required subject. PE shall be taught by a qualified

physical education specialist.

The program shall instruct each student in various physical skills to promote good health and lifelong involvement in physical

activities. Students may participate in activities such as Field Day, Fun Runs, Running Club, or other physical activity clubs.

Appropriate athletic/PE (Tennis, Running, or Basketball) shoes are required to participate in class and in intramurals.

Open-toed shoes, or shoes exposing any skin, will not be permitted. Shoes must have a soft, non-marking, standard-sized

sole (no platform or high-heeled shoes). Shoes shall also be tied tightly/correctly to promote safety of the owner and others

around them.

Water bottles are encouraged for PE classes but must not be a distraction in the classroom. Only WATER is permitted in a

water bottle-no flavored water or other drinks.

### Promotion and Retention of Students

School Board Policies | 5-216 and 2-216A

Promotion from one grade to the next in grades K-6 is based upon the ability to succeed at the next grade level. When
formulating a recommendation, each teacher will work closely with the building level administrator. Above all, the
recommendation must be in the best interest of the student.

Teachers will base their recommendation to promote or retain upon the following criteria:

```
 Successful completion of class assignments, projects, and tests
 Mastery of district objectives
 Achievement on standardized achievement tests
```

```
 Age, maturity, and effort
 Attendance
 Reading fluency by end of grade three (3) – Move on When Reading
```
If facts indicate that retention is in the best interest of the student’s academic progress, close cooperation must exist between
the parents and all school personnel involved. Each student will be given individual consideration. Retention decisions will
be made only after a careful study of facts relating to all phases of the student’s growth and development. The decision to
promote or retain is that of the teacher. **Only the Governing Board may overturn the decision to retain or promote a
student**. (A.R.S. § 15-342 (11)

As required by A.R.S. § 15-701, the Arizona Department of Education has implemented the "Move on When Reading"
policy, which, requires districts to retain students in third grade if they score at the "Falls Far Below" level on the AzMerit
Reading Assessment, Reading Fluency Measures. The policy includes many stipulations about parents' right to appeal,
students who may be exempt from the requirement, and the obligations of the school for students who may be in danger of
retention as a result of this law.

There are four exemptions from A.R.S. § 15-701. A school district governing board or the governing body of a charter school
is allowed to promote a student who earns a score that “falls far below” in the minimally proficient range on the third grade
statewide reading assessment only for the four following reasons:

```
(i) A third grade student is an English Language Learner or Limited English Proficient who has received less than
two years of English instruction; or
(ii) A third grade student with disabilities has an individualized education plan (IEP), and the IEP-team, which
includes the student’s parent/legal guardian, agrees that promotion is appropriate; or
(iii) A third grade students is in the process of a special education referral or evaluation for placement in special
education and/or students that have been diagnosed as having a significant reading impairment, including
dyslexia. (Dyslexia is defined as, a brain-based learning difference that impairs a person's ability to read and
spell that is independent of intelligence and that typically causes a person to read at levels lower than expected.)
```
```
(iv) A pupil who has demonstrated or subsequently demonstrates sufficient reading skills or adequate progress
towards sufficient reading skills of the 3rd grade reading standards as evidenced through a collection of reading
assessments approved by the State Board (SBE) of Arizona, which includes an alternative standardized
reading assessment approved by the SBE.
```
If you have questions or need additional information, please contact the Elementary Education office at 480-812-7610.

The District philosophy is one that values a collaborative partnership between home and school. We have a solid literacy
curriculum, a strong assessment process and individual support systems that are built into daily instruction. Parents will be
kept informed of their children's progress on a regular basis through the child's classroom teacher.


### Screening 45 Days

School Board Policy | 5-

Every child is screened within 45 days of entrance for health, behavior, and academic strengths and weaknesses. This
information is then used to identify those students who may be in need of special services.

### Special Area Classes

**Library**

A library program for grades kindergarten through six shall be provided by a qualified teacher. Instruction shall occur in
separate facilities specifically designed for library services. The library program shall:

- Correlate library skills for each grade level with classroom curriculum. The librarian shall be aware of classroom
    activities that relate to specific library skills and reinforce those skills.

**Music**

Music for grades kindergarten through six shall be a required subject. Music shall be taught by a qualified music specialist.

The music program shall:

- Emphasize music appreciation, music history, note reading, composition, rhythm, instrument identification and
    choral skills.
- It also includes the opportunity for students to perform during music instruction.
- It may include a musical performance by each class during the school year.

All sites, except for Knox Gifted Academy and Weinberg Gifted Academy follow the block schedule for band or orchestra.

(Grades 5 and 6)

```
### Special Education Records

School Board Policy | 5-

Student records maintained by the District in the Special Education department and the process for ensuring confidentiality
and appropriate access to such records is described in more detail under “FERPA (Family Education Rights and Privacy
Act) on the pages 82-83, Notification of Rights under FERPA”. When personally identifiable information about your child in
Special Education is no longer needed to provide educational services to your child, the information is stored for a minimum
of two years after the date your child was last enrolled in this school district. After two years, Special Education records are
referred for long-term storage. Please contact the district office of Special Education if you have questions about record
maintenance or require assistance with obtaining your child’s records from Special Education after leaving Chandler
Schools.

### Special Programs/Services

School Board Policy | 5-

```
 Compensatory Education Programs: These federally and state funded programs target students with specified
barriers to academic success and/or who attend schools with high percentages of lower income families.
```

```
 Title I Reading & Math: This compensatory education program helps students in eligible low-income schools to
master the Arizona Academic Standards.
 Sheltered English Instruction (SEI): The district provides specialized educational services to students whose
primary language is other than English and whose English skills are not yet proficient. The specific intent of SEI
instruction is to improve the students’ English listening, speaking, reading and writing skills so that they may
succeed in all their regular education classes.
 Indian Education: Native American students may receive supplemental education service or resources as well as
participate in activities that promote cultural and self-awareness made available through small federal and state
grant awards.

```
### Other Special Programs

School Board Policy | 5-

```
 Gifted – Special classes and services are provided for students who demonstrate superior skills (according to
Arizona State guidelines) in verbal, quantitative and non-verbal abilities. (See Testing and Evaluation, page 21)
 Alternative Classroom – Opportunity School This program provides small pupil-teacher ratio, a structured student
management system, and a social skills curriculum for students with behavior needs. Students assigned by CUSD
to the Opportunity Placement will participate in Behavioral Counseling program to aide in the successful
transition. Our ultimate goal is for students to participate and fully function in the general education classroom.
```
### State Standards and District Curriculum

School Board Policies | 5-207 and 5-

The Chandler Unified School District aligns the district’s curriculum to the Arizona State Standards to ensure students are
learning the required content and are prepared for state testing. The curriculum is frequently revised based on teacher input,
changes in state standards and performance objectives, and test score analysis. The curriculum is available on the district’s
website at [http://www.cusd80.com.](http://www.cusd80.com.) If you have questions about your child’s curriculum, ask the teacher, principal or call the
Curriculum Office at 480-224-3709.

### Technology

Technology shall be integrated into the curriculum as an additional resource that offers the student quality practice or for
reference or communication related to a specific subject. Computer skills, such as keyboarding will be taught where
developmentally appropriate. Students will enhance the writing process using Word, Excel, Power Point and other programs
to create documents. In addition to the integration of technology within classroom instruction, students will be provided
opportunities to initiate practice and problem-solving skills with technology through an additional pull-out special that is
scheduled weekly with the site technology teacher.


Internet access requires a signed electronic user agreement to be on file for each student. See pages 70-76 for more
information.

### Testing and Evaluation

School Board Policy | 5-205A

In order to meet the individual needs of all students, the following evaluation instruments and techniques are used to assess
and evaluate the needs of each child. The results are used to place the child in the proper environment which will foster
success.

```
KIST – Chandler’s Kindergarten Individual Skills Test may be given to students prior to the beginning of
Kindergarten. This evaluation assists the teacher in providing the necessary instruction for the student’s social and
academic growth.
```
```
DIBELS – Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills are a set of standardized, individually administered
measures of early literacy development. They are designed to be short (one minute) fluency measures used to
regularly monitor the development of pre-reading and early reading skills. The assessment is provided to all
students several times per year with the express purpose of identifying (as early as possible) students who are not
making expected progress and to assess the effectiveness of the core curriculum.
```
```
State Testing – All students in grades 3rd - 8th complete the annual state required assessment in reading, writing
and math each year. Tests are administered during the months of March and April. State mandated tests are very
important, and the district strives to ensure that all students have the necessary skills to perform well on them.
```
```
Individual Standardized Tests – These tests are given when more specific information is needed for the diagnosis
of individual learning problems. These are given by support personnel such as counselors, Special Education
teachers, psychologists and therapists.
```
```
Chandler Academically Talented Students (CATS) Identification – A two-level process is used to identify pupils
eligible for gifted placement according to Arizona State regulations. For grades 4 and above: Level 1: District
standardized tests may be used to screen pupils scoring at or above the 95th percent or percentile in any or all
areas. These children in addition to those referred by parents and teachers, are then eligible (upon parental
consent) for Level II evaluation. Level II consists of the Cognitive Abilities Test. For grade 3: All 2nd graders are
given the Cognitive Abilities Test. For grades K – 2nd, children referred by parents and/or teachers are eligible (upon
parental consent) to take the Cognitive Abilities Test. A student must score at or above the 97th percentile
equivalency for his/her grade level in Verbal, Quantitative or Non-Verbal.
```
### Textbooks/Library Books

School Board Policies | 3-104 and 5-214

Textbooks are assigned to each student upon enrollment and are for the current school year only. Students are responsible
for the proper care of all books. They are to be collected at the end of the year and are expected to be in good condition.
The student must pay for textbooks or library books which have been lost or badly damaged.


## GENERAL SCHOOL INFORMATION

### Approved Flyers

School Board Policy | 2-101

Flyers for local non-profit organizations sponsoring student activities and flyers that promote third party invitations to
students or parents who attend our schools, may be approved through our Community Education Department. Once the
flyer is reviewed and approved they may be available to parents or students at a central location designated by the school.
Community members who wish to distribute flyers should contact our Community Education Office at 480-224-3900.

### Attendance

School Board Policy | 5-103

Regular attendance and punctual arrival at school are two habits that dramatically impact student achievement. Absences
and tardiness are disturbing for all students; both disrupt their schedules and require readjustment to the class routine.

```
Tardiness
If a student is late for school (after the tardy bell), he/she must report to the office before going to the classroom.
The student will be given a pass to take to the classroom teacher. It is important to know that excessive tardiness
may result in an unexcused absence.
```
**Absences**
 Students who are not in school 90% (18 absences) excused or unexcused or 5 unexcused absences of the school
days in which they have been enrolled may be reported to the County Attorney’s Office as truant or parent may be
cited. _A.R.S. § 15-802 or 15-803._ If a student is absent ten days, we are required to notify parents in writing. All
sites will issue a ten day letter upon a student’s 10th absence. Please understand this is a function of the system
and letters are automatically sent at 10 and 18 days. Any discrepancies can be discussed with the school office.
 All students should be in class every day unless they are ill. It is very important that the school be notified as soon
as possible. A voicemail to the school’s attendance office can be left on a 24-hour basis.
 When reporting an absence, please specify the reason for absence.
 If the school in not notified early in the morning, school personnel will make an attempt to contact the parent/legal
guardian to determine why the student is not in school. An early call to the school’s attendance line will save staff
time and help ensure the child’s safety.
 If notification is not received, the student will be given an unexcused absence. The student must then present a
note to the school attendance clerk stating the date and reason for the absence and signed by the parent/legal
guardian.
 Parents are urged to schedule doctor, dentist, and other appointments for students at times outside the school day.
This will reinforce the importance of school and will prevent the student from getting behind his/her work.
 When requesting class work missed during an absence please contact the school office before 11 a.m. to provide
adequate time for the teacher to prepare materials to be sent home or picked up at the end of the school day.


### Bicycles, Skates, Scooters, and Skateboards

Students in grades 2nd-6th may ride bicycles or scooters to school with parent consent. We suggest that the bikes and
scooters have a sturdy lock and be registered with the city. Helmets are strongly recommended. Bikes and scooters must
be walked across campus at all times. Failure to do so may result in the student losing the privilege of riding his/her bike or
scooter to school. Motorized bicycles and scooters are prohibited. Please remember the importance of bicycle and scooter
safety, and follow the established rules at all times.

**Schools and the School District are not responsible for lost, stolen or damaged personal possessions.**

Occasionally, a parent may request that a student regularly walk or ride a bike/scooter to school using a path that involves
crossing a major roadway with no crossing guard. If the CUSD provides busing from a particular area, it is because it has
deemed it too far or unsafe for a student to walk and the district will not allow a student to walk or ride a bike/scooter from
that area. (School Board Policy | 3-401)

### Classroom Celebrations

With the understanding that a classroom celebration may be engaged in at certain times throughout the school year, these
celebrations are to be kept to a minimum with an emphasis on scheduling to avoid excessive loss of instructional time. Site
administration may determine further restrictions/conditions as necessary.

### Cell Phones and Smart Watches

School Board Policies | 5-305 and 5-306

If you, as a parent or legal guardian, have decided that it is necessary for your child to carry a cell phone and/or smart
watch, we ask that you be aware of the following and discuss with your child:
A. The Chandler School District does not assume responsibility for the loss of, or damage to, personal property. If
your child has a cell phone and/or smart watch on campus or on the bus and it is damaged or stolen, we will not be
able to utilize administrative time to investigate the incident, nor will the District take any financial responsibility for
the cell phone and/or smart watch or cell phone charges.

**Schools and the School District are not responsible for lost, stolen or damaged personal possessions.** (School
Board Policy | 3-104 and 3-401)

### Check Acceptance/Returned Check Policy

School Board Policy | 5-214

Checks are gladly accepted by CUSD. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information
from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check
transaction. For inquiries, please call District Office 480-812-7000.

When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account
as soon as the same day you make your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution.


For any checks returned as unpaid to CUSD, the check writer’s account may be electronically debited without further notice
for the amount of the check, plus a returned check fee as allowed by state law, currently $25. Questions or issues regarding
returned checks may be directed to Check Redi at 1-800-686-9522.

### Community Resource

Chandler Unified School District offers families a wide variety of services through the **Chandler CARE Center.** These
services include health and dental care, access to Southwest Behavioral Health Services, WIC support, and a food bank.
The Chandler CARE Center is located on the North East corner of the Galveston Elementary School Campus. For more
information, call the Chandler CARE Center at 480- 812-7900.

### Counseling/Student Services

Each elementary school is staffed with a certified counselor or a student services coordinator. The counselor or student
services coordinator may provide student support and consultation to teachers, administrators, and parents regarding
academic and/or behavioral issues. They also coordinate special education services. See "Notification of Rights under the
Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment” on page 84 for certain parent and rights associated with counseling.

### Curricular Activities

Curricular activities are activities conducted during regular school hours. These activities can vary by site.

Students are expected to be well-behaved during all curricular activities. A student may be excluded from a curricular
activity at the discretion of the teacher or principal. Games and recreational activities shall be related to an academic

endeavor.

### Curriculum Night

This is an opportunity to learn more about your child’s school and classroom. Information about your child's preschool
program and curriculum will be shared at this event.

#### Custody

In most cases, when parents are divorced, both parents continue to have equal rights concerning their children. Please
ensure that disagreements about custodial issues are resolved outside of the school.

If you have a court order that limits the rights of one parent in matters such as custody or visitation, please bring a copy to
the school office. Unless your legal documents are on file with us, we must provide equal rights to both parents.


#### Driving Services

Services such as Lyft, Taxis, Uber, etc. will not be permitted as means of transportation from school, and therefore students
will not be released to such services at any time during the school day including arrival or dismissal.

#### Drop-off and Pick-up of Students

Please stay in line while entering the parking lot and pull as far forward as possible along the curb. Students shall enter or exit
cars at the curb. Parents shall remain in their cars. Parents who need to leave their cars shall do so only after parking in an
established parking space. Students shall be accompanied at all times by an adult when walking from the curb to the parking
lot. Parents must sign in students arriving late, and sign out students leaving early. Please refrain from talking on a cell phone
at any time while picking up and/or dropping off your students.

#### Early Dismissal Days

School Board Policy | 2-101

There are four days listed on the school calendar as Early Dismissal Days. During these days we conduct parent-teacher
conferences. These days are infrequent, but give teachers and parent the opportunity to communicate regarding student
progress. In addition to the parent teacher conference days, the last day of school will also be an early release day. Your
school will remind you of these dates. Additional days may be determined by the Superintendent of schools and will be
communicated in advance.

#### Evacuation and Lock-Down Drills

School Board Policy | 3-401

Fire drills are conducted on a monthly basis and are monitored by local municipality Fire Departments. These drills teach
the students the safest, quickest route from their classrooms and school buildings. Whenever a class leaves a room for an
emergency, students stay with their teachers until they hear the signal to return to class.

Our schools also practice lock-down procedures. These lockdown drills prepare our staff and students to quickly take cover
in a secure room should it be necessary.

#### Evening Programs

Evening programs provide an opportunity for students to share their accomplishments with family and friends. Students
should be accompanied by an adult to ensure their safety and the prompt availability of a ride home.


#### Extended Absences

School Board Policy | 3-107D

Parents/legal guardians must contact the school if their child will be absent for an extended time period. Unauthorized
absence from school is considered truancy and will be treated as such. After 10 days of unexcused continued absence, the
student will be dropped from the class rolls and/or legal action may be taken in accordance with School Board Policy.

#### Extracurricular Activities

Extracurricular activities are an integral part of the school. These activities may include ch o rus, running club, drama,
sports, yearbook, computers, and Student Council. Extracurricular activities shall be conducted before or after regular
school hours or during lunch and shall not be graded. Activity Fees may be charged according to district guidelines and

may vary by site.

#### Extracurricular Activities Fees

School Board Policy | 5-214

Each year the District schools use tax credit donations to fund many extracurricular activities.

Extracurricular activities are defined both in A.R.S. § 43-1089.01 and A.R.S. § 15-342(24). Under those definitions, the only
activities which qualify as extracurricular activities for which a school may collect and spend Extracurricular Activity (ECA)
tax credit donations are those activities which are:

```
(a) Optional;
(b) Non-credit;
(c) School-sponsored;
(d) Educational or recreational activities that supplement the school’s educational program;
(e) For enrolled students; and
(f) Require the students to pay a fee to the District in order to participate.
```
At the July 9, 2014 the District School Board meeting, an extracurricular activity fee schedule for the various activities was
adopted. The approved fees are available at your child’s school. It is important to know that 1) **ALL** fees, if required, will be
deposited into the account of the activity your student participates, 2) the fees you provide may qualify for a tax credit and
3) there are provisions for the principal to reduce and/or waive fees for families with an economic hardship.

#### Field Trips

School Board Policies | 5-213 and 5-213A

Field trips are an extension of concepts taught in the classroom. They are encouraged and supported. **Only children
exhibiting responsible behavior may go on field trips**. Parents are often asked to serve as chaperones and supervisors


for various field trips and their assistance is truly appreciated. The district guidelines state that there should be at least one
adult for every ten students. The purpose of a parent volunteer on a field trip is to actively supervise students assigned to
them, so no younger children are allowed. Sometimes parents who are not selected as chaperones wish to participate in
the field trip experience with their child and travel to the field trip site independently. We respectfully request that parents
not selected as chaperones refrain from attending and make separate arrangements to attend with the child at another time.
Please refer to School Board Policy 5-213, as it pertains to out-of-state field trips and conditions of support. A parent may
request to transport their own child but may not transport other children.

In some cases, sites may have academic behavior agreements in place for students to meet in order to attend a specific
trip. Please ask your child’s teacher.

#### Food at School

We realize that parents may wish to bring home-baked treats to school. However, due to a number of issues, such as food
allergies, etc., serving home-baked foods to students is prohibited.

#### Fundraising

The Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) may direct fundraisers each school year. Families are encouraged to participate
together in this activity. Door-to-door sales by students are strongly discouraged.

Other fundraising activities on campus involving students shall take place before school, after school, or at lunchtime, and

must be approved by the principal.

#### Insurance

Your child’s school does not provide medical insurance coverage for school accidents. This means that you are responsible
for the medical bills if your child gets hurt during school activities. Student accident/health insurance plans are offered to
help you pay those bills. The Student Health Care and High Option 24-hour Accident plans are especially recommended
for those students with no other insurance because they provide the most help when injuries occur. Student Health Care
covers illness as well as injury, 24 hours a day. If your child does have other health coverage, student insurance may also
be used to help pay those charges not covered by other insurance. If your child qualifies for Medicare, you must obtain from
your school office a copy of the “Important Notice to Persons on Medicare” prior to applying for student insurance. Insurance
forms are sent home the first week of school and may be obtained in the school office at any time other than that.

#### Meet the Teacher

Parents/legal guardians and students will have the opportunity to visit the classroom before school is in session. This event
helps to ensure a smooth transition on the first day of school.


#### Lost and Found

Please put names on clothing and personal things brought to school. Taking some time to do this before school begins may
save the cost of buying replacements.

Lost items are stored in the school office for owners to claim. The school will call a charitable group when lost and found
becomes too full. Please contact the school office if something is lost at school. Many items, especially clothing, go
unclaimed all year.

#### Not Appropriate for School

School Board Policies | 5-305 and 5-306

Students are not to bring toys, games, radios, etc. to school except with the teacher’s permission. The following materials
deemed not appropriate for elementary age children are not allowed at school at any time: knives, weapons of any kind
(real or simulated), cigarettes, tobacco products, drugs, water guns, baseballs, roller blades. These items and anything else
that may cause disruption to the learning environment will be taken from the student and consequences may be issued.
(See Student Code of Conduct, page 11 and also Behavior and Discipline on pages 37-61.)

**Students are not permitted to bring pets to school. Special permission may be granted ONLY with written
authorization from the parent, teacher and school administration.** (School Board Policy 3-202B)

Please be aware that bringing dangerous items to school, even after hours or on weekends, can result in serious
consequences.

**Schools and the School District are not responsible for lost, stolen or damaged personal possessions.**
(School Board Policy | 5-104)

#### Open Enrollment

School Board Policies | 5-105 and 5-105A

Open Enrollment enables Arizona students to attend public schools outside their attendance area. In accordance with state
law, the District has established an open enrollment policy and implemented an open enrollment program without charging
tuition for non-resident students and resident transfer students. The District does not transport open enrollment students
except as set forth in A.R.S. § 15-816.1.

Open Enrollment applications are received the second Monday of January for the following school year.

Students on an open enrollment and returning to the same school will not need to re-apply for open enrollment, however,
open enrollments are reviewed annually by school sites.

Visit [http://www.cusd80.com/elementaryopenenrollment](http://www.cusd80.com/elementaryopenenrollment) for more information.


#### Parent Concerns

**A parent who has concerns about any matter involving a student should initially speak to the staff member
involved. If unable to come to a resolution with the staff member, the parent should contact the school
administrator.** If necessary, a meeting will be held. If no resolution can be reached, the parent may contact the appropriate
district administrator. (See also: Student Concerns, Complaints and Grievances, pages 41-44). We do ask that situations
be communicated with an attempt to resolve at the site level.

#### Parent Pick-Up/Late Pickup

With the understanding that emergencies do occur, we ask that parents/legal guardians maintain communication with the
school office and/or child’s teacher should they be late in picking up from school or any school related extra-curricular event
(clubs, tutoring, etc.). Should a child be late getting picked up without prior communication from the parent/legal guardian,
the school office and/or classroom teacher will wait 10 minutes and then make an attempt to contact the parent. If this
contact is unsuccessful, the school will attempt to contact an approved emergency contact as recorded on their emergency
form. Should continue attempts be made with no success, local law enforcement may be contacted to assist.

The parent/legal guardian agrees to advise the school office and classroom teacher immediately of any changes regarding
their personal contact information, including address, email, and phone numbers for home, work, and cell. Any change in
emergency contacts and/or contingency routines must be communicated to the school office and classroom teacher.

#### Parent/Student Check Out

In the event your child must leave school (doctor appt., etc.) during the school day, we require that a parent/legal guardian
sign him/her out in order that we may comply with state guidelines regarding our responsibility for student safety. In
compliance with District policy, before releasing a student during the school day, the administration/teacher shall be
responsible for the verification of the identity of any lawful custodian or any representative seeking release of a student. If
a lawful custodian, as indicated on the student’s permanent record, is not recognized by site, the administration/teacher
shall require a picture ID before such release. If there is a doubt, release may not be granted. If it is necessary for another
adult to check out your student, (in a non-emergency situation) you must give permission by sending a note or calling the
school office and ensure that person’s name is listed on the child’s emergency card. Generally, we do not call students to
the office until the parent arrives at the school.

#### Parent Teacher Organization (PTO)

School Board Policy | 5-401

The District is proud of its Parent Teacher Organizations (PTO). Parents/legal guardians are strongly encouraged to take
an active role in their child’s school life by becoming a part of the parent organization. The PTO’s help us improve
communication and education in the District schools and they sponsor many events and services. They volunteer their time
as classroom aides, assist in the office, supervise field trips, participate in school events, sponsor fundraisers and support
the staff and students in a most positive way. PTO’s must maintain membership with Chandler Schools Booster (CSB) in
order to access and operate on CUSD campuses.


#### Phone Calls to Teachers

To facilitate good communication and ensure security, each CUSD teacher has a phone in his/her classroom. If parents
would like to talk with their child’s teacher, they should call the school office either before classes begin or after students
are dismissed. During instructional hours, you may leave a message for the teacher, as calls are sent directly to voicemail
to ensure that interruptions in class time are kept to a minimum. The teacher will make every effort to return the call on the
same day or within 24 hours. If an emergency occurs during the school day, please call the school’s main office and our
office staff will assist you.

#### Playgrounds

We realize that students may sometimes wish to return to campus after school for the purpose of playing on the playground
equipment. If parents choose to allow children to play unsupervised on the school playgrounds after school, they are not
allowed to return to campus until 5:00 p.m. when most school related activity has ceased.

#### Playground Rules

Students shall:

1. play in the designated areas.
2. play away from irrigation and muddy areas.
3. only throw or kick items specifically designed to be thrown or kicked.
4. use good sportsmanship at all times.
5. play safe non-violent games (no tackling, grabbing clothing, tripping or pushing).
6. use playground equipment as intended.
7. obtain permission from the teacher or staff on duty before leaving the playground.
8. not handle broken glass or harmful objects and report the item to the staff on duty.

9. (^) not play tag on the playground equipment.

10. swing in only one direction.

Please refer to each school’s site-specific considerations.


#### Preschoolers/Younger Siblings at School

School Board Policy | 3-401

While we greatly appreciate our parent volunteers, district guidelines do not allow for parents to have preschoolers and/or
siblings accompany them while volunteering.

#### Publicity

School Board Policy | 5-303B

Occasionally a student’s photograph/image is used for official school and/or district publicity. Publicity may include the
school’s website, newsletter, or local newspaper. Parents may request that their student not be included in publicity by
marking “No” in the online Infinite Campus Parent Portal.

#### Registration/Admission

School Board Policies | 5-102, 5-102A, and 5-103

To register a child in school for the first time, an original birth certificate or other satisfactory evidence of age, such as
baptismal certificate will be necessary. When enrolling a student, parents/legal guardians will be required to fill out several
forms in order to complete registration. Information such as emergency phone numbers, physicians’ phone numbers, proof
of residence, etc. will be required. Immunization requirements are covered under “Health and Safety” on pages 62-69.

A child must be five years old before September 1st of the school year to enroll in kindergarten. Children who turn five
between September 1st and December 31st may be assessed to determine readiness for kindergarten. To enter first grade,
a child must be six years old before September 1st, unless entering after completion of kindergarten in a public school with
a differing entrance requirement.

#### School Ceremonies and Observances

School Board Policy | 5-201

The following shall be adhered to regarding required opening exercises and school programs as they pertain to customs and
holidays:

```
A. Each student shall be provided with an opportunity to participate in the Pledge of Allegiance or other patriotic
observance each day.
B. Each student in grades four (4) through six (6) shall recite the following passage from the Declaration of
Independence:
```
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain
unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments
are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed..."


#### School Pictures

A professional photography company will visit each school in the fall and spring to take individual student pictures and
individual class pictures. Packets of color photos will be offered for sale to parents.

#### School Supplies

State law requires that elementary schools provide students with all materials required for classroom activities. In
compliance with this law, the district provides students with textbooks, pencils, paper, and the necessary supplies for
classroom activities.

Students may bring additional supplies from home for their personal use but are not required to do so.

#### School Visits/Volunteers

School Board Policies | 3-201, 3-203, and 3-203A

Please feel free to visit the school. We do ask that, as a courtesy, you notify the teachers before visiting. If you visit our
schools, you will need to register in the front office and receive a visitor badge. **Visitors and volunteers must be 18 years
or older. The school will terminate visiting privileges for any parent or legal guardian who is interfering with
instruction during the visit or who does not conduct him/herself appropriately and professionally**.

```
 In order to support the dress code and to set a good example for our students, parents are asked to wear modest
attire when on campus to have lunch, visit classrooms, or volunteer, etc.
 We do not allow children from other schools to visit our students during school hours.
 Should you wish to observe your child on the playground while visiting the school, please ask school officials for
directions. During these observations, we require that parents refrain from playing on the playgrounds with their
children.
 While we greatly appreciate our parent volunteers, district guidelines do not allow for parents to have preschoolers
and/or siblings accompany them while volunteering.
```

#### Site Council

A school site council shall be established at each school to provide a cooperative procedure for determining goals and
educational philosophies of the school. The council, like all other governance or administrative units of District, operates
within the guidelines of District Governing Board policy, budget, ethics, and law. This governing body is organized with
representation of parents and staff to uphold the educational foundation of the school. The Site Council meets at least four
times each year.

```
Meetings
```
• (^) The council shall meet regularly and more often if business dictates.

- Operating procedures of the council shall be determined by the council.
- Minutes of each council meeting shall be taken, and the results of actions shall be distributed to the
    members and shall be made available to the general public.

Minutes of the previous meeting will be available in the school office.

#### Staff Qualifications

School Board Policy | 4-101

The Every Student Success Act (ESSA) gives you the right to ask for information regarding your child’s teacher. ARS §15-
341(A)(29) Notice to parents – An employee's educational and teaching background and experience in a particular
academic content subject area shall be made available for inspection on request of parents and legal guardians of pupils
enrolled at a the student’s school. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any school to release personally
identifiable information in relation to any teacher or employee, including the teacher's or employee's address, salary, social
security number or telephone number. Information may include:

```
 the students’ teacher has met State qualification and licensing criteria for the grade levels and subject areas which
the teacher provides instruction.
 the students’ teacher is teaching under emergency or other provisional status through which State qualification or
licensing criteria have been waived.
 the students’ teacher is teaching in the field of discipline of the certification of the teacher.
 the child is provided services by paraprofessionals and if so, their qualifications.
```
If you would like this information, please contact your child’s principal.

#### Student Council

School Board Policy | 5-212
A Student Council is established in each elementary school. The purpose is to provide students with an opportunity to
participate in student government and decision making. Elections are held for various offices.


#### Student Dress Code

School Board Policy | 5-302

Students will be expected to keep themselves well-groomed and neatly dressed at all times. **Any form of dress or
hairstyle which is considered contrary to good hygiene or which is distractive or disruptive in appearance and
detrimental to the purpose or conduct of the school will not be permitted.** (See Personal Grooming Standards and
Clothing Charts on page 35 for specific examples.) As a choice option, Chandler Traditional Academy (CTA) sites have a
prescribed dress outlined in the Traditional Academy Addendum on pages 94-95. In addition, as per A.R.S. § 15 – 342(22),
school sites may have a uniform or prescribed dress. (Please check with school sites as to specifics.)

Since fashions and name designations for wearing apparel change frequently, the administration, with the advice and
counsel of police, faculty, students, and parents, may provide an interpretation of garments that are questionable.

The dress code is in compliance with A.R.S. § 15 – 342(22).

```
 Clothing or hairstyles that are detrimental to one's health and safety or the health and safety of others are not
permitted.
 Clothing shall be modest, clean, and appropriate for school wear.
 Students shall not wear: tank tops, halter tops, garments with spaghetti straps, strapless garments, and fishnet
stockings. Garments that are “see-through,” cut low, or expose one’s midriff are not acceptable. Sleeveless
garments must extend to the end of the shoulders and fit closely under the arms. Clothing should have adequate
coverage to allow a full range of motion movement without skin or undergarments showing. Undergarments must
not be visible. Clothing must cover the entire buttocks and extend to a reasonable length to ensure modesty.
 Students will be required to remove sunglasses while inside the buildings.
 Footwear must be worn for good health safety. Students cannot wear athletic shoes with cleats, “house shoes” or
slippers on campus.
 Monogrammed shirts that advertise illegal substances for minors are not allowed (i.e. cigarettes, liquor of any kind,
drugs, and lewd or sexually suggestive messages). Garments identified as gang related attire by school
administration and/ or local police departments are not permitted in school.
 Court imposed monitoring devices must be covered at all times.
 Outer garments worn over prohibited items do not necessarily make these garments acceptable. Visible
undergarments are prohibited.
 Chains, hanging belts, and spiked bracelets/necklaces/earrings are not allowed on campus.
 All school personnel have the responsibility and right to enforce all school rules, including dress code guidelines.
Students inappropriately dressed for school will remedy the situation before returning to class.
```
**The school administration retains the final discretion in determining if a garment, accessory, or appearance
complies with the dress code.** Repeated violations of the dress standard may result in appropriate disciplinary action being
taken, including suspension from school.

### Corrective Action by School Staff

School Board Policy | 5-306

All school personnel have the right and responsibility to enforce school rules including dress and grooming expectations.
Students who do not comply with dress or grooming expectations will be referred to the school health office or to the school
principal. Parents will be contacted and asked to provide alternative clothing. If parents are not available, students will be
given alternative clothing to wear for the remainder of the day. Parents will also be contacted concerning grooming issues.
Arrangements will be made with parents to correct grooming issues as quickly as possible.

**Note:** Some Chandler schools require school uniforms. These schools will provide detailed information as to the uniform
requirements.

### Student Records

School Board Policy | 5-303

Parents are advised that Chandler Schools, in compliance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and
the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) strictly control all required aspects of creating, maintaining,
transferring, and disposing of student records. Parents have specific rights to review and inspect their child’s records and
to know about their disposition, including the publishing of “directory” information about their child. District policies and
procedures are available for parent review in the school office. Please call your principal if you have questions about FERPA
or IDEA. (See FERPA statement on pages 82-83)

### Student Use of School Phone

Students will not be permitted to use the school telephone unless it is an emergency or for a matter the school officials
deem necessary. We believe that remembering homework and musical instruments, etc. is the student’s responsibility.
Therefore, phone calls for situations like these are not allowed. In addition, please make arrangements for after school
activities with your child at home (e.g., Boy Scout meetings, friends’ birthday parties, etc.).

### Take Your Son/Daughter to Work Day

The District has asked parents and legal guardians to observe “Take Your Son and Daughter to Work Day” on a day other
than during the school year. Local corporations have joined with us to designate a non-school day for this purpose.

### Transfer/Withdrawal Procedures

If it becomes necessary to transfer or withdraw your child from school, please notify the school attendance technician at
least one week in advance of his/her last day. Plan on checking your child out at the school office on the last day, at which
time the attendance technician will provide you with the required paperwork.


## BEHAVIOR AND DISCIPLINE

### Bullying/Harassment/Intimidation

School Board Policy | 5-409

**Bullying/Harassment/Intimidation Policy**
Retaliatory or intimidating acts against any student who has made a complaint under this policy and its corresponding
regulation, or against a student who has testified, assisted or participated in any manner in an investigation relating to a
complaint or grievance, are specifically prohibited and constitute grounds for a separate complaint. _Knowingly submitting a
false report under this policy shall subject the student to discipline up to an including suspension or expulsion. Where
disciplinary action is necessary pursuant to any part of this policy, relevant district policies shall be followed._

The Governing Board believes it is the right of every student to be educated in a positive, safe, caring, and respectful
learning environment. The Board further believes a school environment inclusive of these traits maximizes student
achievement, fosters student personal growth, and helps students build a sense of community that promotes participation
as members of society. To assist in achieving a school environment base on the beliefs of the Governing Board, bullying,
harassment or intimidation as defined by this policy will not be tolerated.

**Bullying** = occurs over an extended period of time, and may include, but is not limited to, verbal, written/printed or graphic

### Hazing

School Board Policy | 5-408

There shall be no hazing, solicitation to engage in hazing, or aiding and abetting another who is engaged in hazing, of any
person enrolled, accepted for or promoted to enrollment, or intending to enroll or be promoted to District schools within
twelve calendar months. For purposes of this policy a person, as specified above, shall be considered a “student” until
graduation, transfer, promotion or withdrawal from the District school. “Hazing” means any intentional, knowing, or reckless
act committed by a student, whether individually or in concert with other persons, against another student and which both
of the following apply:

```
 The act was committed in connection with an initiation into an affiliation with or the maintenance of membership
in any organization that is affiliated with an educational institution.
 The act contributes to a substantial risk of potential physical injury, mental harm or degradation, or causes physical
injury, mental harm or personal degradation.
```
“Organization” means an athletic team, association, order, society, corps, cooperative, club, or similar group that is affiliated
with an educational institution and whose membership consists primarily of students enrolled at that educational institution.
It is no defense to a violation of this policy if the victim consented or acquiesced to hazing. Report all acts of hazing to a
teacher or an administrator immediately. In accord with statute, violations of this policy do not include either of the following:

```
 Customary athletic events, contests or competitions that are sponsored by an educational institution.
 Any activity or conduct that furthers the goals of a legitimate educational curriculum, a legitimate extracurricular
program, or a legitimate military training program.
```

All students, teachers and staff shall take reasonable measures within the scope of their individual authority to prevent
violations of this policy. Students and others may report hazing to any professional staff member.

Professional staff members must report the incident to the school administrator or next higher administrative supervisor, in
writing, with such details as may have been provided. A failure by a staff member to timely inform the school administrator
or next higher administrative supervisor of a hazing allegation or their observation of an incident of hazing may subject the
staff member to disciplinary action in accord with District policies. The staff member shall preserve the confidentiality of
those involved, disclosing the incident only to the appropriate school administrator or next higher administrative supervisor
or as otherwise required by law. If evidence suggests that conduct complained of under this policy also constitutes a crime,
the supervisor shall stop the investigation and promptly report to the appropriate law enforcement agency. If evidence
suggests the conduct complained of under this policy constitutes child abuse, the incident should be reported according to
the Administrative Regulation JLF. The requirement to report abuse applies to situations in which a child is the alleged
abuser, as well as to situations in which an adult is the alleged abuser. Any instance of reported or observed hazing which
includes possible child abuse or violations of statutes known to the staff member shall be treated in accord with statutory
requirements and be reported to a law enforcement agency.

To assure that students and staff are aware of its content and intent, a notice of this policy and procedure shall be posted
conspicuously in each school building and shall be made a part of the rights and responsibilities section of the student
handbook. Forms for submitting complaints are to be available to students and staff in the school offices.

Disposition of all reports/complaints shall be reported to the Superintendent. The Superintendent will determine if the
policies of the District have been appropriately implemented and will make such reports and/or referrals to the Board as
may be necessary.

All violations of this policy shall be treated in accord with the appropriate procedures and penalties provided for in District
policies related to the conduct and discipline of students, staff, and others.

### Interrogations & Searches/Seizures

School Board Policies | 5-304, 5-401, and 5-402

In cases involving law enforcement authorities, the administration will contact the student’s parent/legal guardians to give
them an opportunity to be present during questioning. There are, however, certain exceptions to this procedure as per
Governing Board Policy JIH.

School employees may conduct searches when they have reason to suspect that the health, safety, or welfare of students
may be in jeopardy.

The guidelines are as follows:

1. General searches of school property including personal items found on the school property may be conducted at
    any time when there is reasonable cause for school employees to believe that something which violates a law or
    school rule is on school property. General searches may be made without the student present.
2. Illegal items or other possessions reasonably determined to be a threat to the safety or security of others, or which
    might possibly interfere with school purposes may be seized by school employees.


3. Items which are used to disrupt or interfere with the educational process may be removed from a student’s
    possession.
4. A student’s person may be searched by school employees when there is a reasonable cause to believe that the
    student has possession of illegal items or other items that may interfere with school purposes.
5. Student desks, lockers, etc. and other storage areas are school property. The school may search student areas on
    a periodic basis to protect the health, safety, and rights of all students.

School Board Policies | 1-201A and 5-409

**_The following procedures will be followed when a student or a student’s parent or legal guardian wishes to present
a concern, complaint, grievance or appeal that falls within the scope of Policy JII._**

**_Complaint form_****.** The District shall make a Complaint form (1-201A) available at each school and at the District Office.
The form shall also be available in electronic format. Complainants are encouraged to utilize this form, but shall not be
required to do so. In order to provide the District with the information necessary to properly address the matter, any written
Complaint that is filed should contain the same information that is requested on 1-201A (at a minimum). The Complaint

**_Referral._** A referral will be made to the appropriate individual for investigation and response or take other appropriate
action.

**_Acknowledgment of receipt of complaint_**. The complainant will be provided with a written confirmation of the District’s

in response to the investigation.
```
```
Maintenance of records. The District will maintain a confidential record of each complaint made pursuant to Policy JII
at the District office. The record shall include a copy of the complaint or grievance filed by a student, findings of the
investigation, and the disposition of the matter.
```
```

```
### Student Interrogations, Searches and Arrests

```
School Board Policies | 5-304, 5-401, and 5-401A
```
```
INTERVIEWS: School officials may question students without limitation with regards to all relevant matters. The parent
will be contacted if a student interviewed is then subject to discipline for a serious offense. A student may decline at
any time to be interviewed by the School Resource Officer (SRO) or another peace officer.
```

**_CHILD ABUSE CASES_** : If a child protective services (DCS) worker or peace officer enters the campus requesting to

interview a student attending the school, the school administrator shall be notified. Access to interview shall be granted

when the child to be interviewed is the subject of or is the sibling of or is living with the child who is the subject of an

abuse or abandonment investigation. The personnel of the District shall cooperate with the investigating child protective

services worker or peace officer. If a student is taken into temporary custody in accordance with A.R.S. § 8-821, the
child protective services worker or peace officer may be reminded to notify the student's parent of the custody, pursuant

to A.R.S. § 8-823. The child protective services worker or peace officer shall be requested to establish proper

identification and complete and sign a "Form for Signature of Interviewing Officer." Six (6) hours following the

relinquishment of custody by the school, school personnel may respond to inquiries about the temporary custody of the

child and may, if considered necessary, call the parent.

**_CASES WHERE SCHOOL SAFETY IS NOT AN ISSUE:_** If a peace officer enters the campus requesting to interview

a student attending the school on an issue other than upon request of the school or for abuse or abandonment, the

school administrator shall be notified. If the officer directs that parents are not to be contacted because the interview is

related to criminal activity of the parent(s)/legal guardian(s), the school official shall comply with the request. Unless

these circumstances exist the parent will be contacted and will be asked if they wish the student to be interviewed. If

the parent consents the parent will be requested to be present or to authorize the interview in their absence within the

school day of the request. Where an attempt was made and the parent(s) could not be reached or did not consent within
the school day of the request, the peace officer will then be requested to contact the parent(s) and make arrangements

to question the student at another time and place.

**_CASES WHERE STUDENT SAFETY IS AN ISSUE_** _:_ When a peace officer is present on the campus to interview

students at the request of school authorities due to concerns for the safety of the students in the school population,

parent contact shall only be made if a student is taken into custody or following the determination that the student may
be subject to discipline for a serious offense. The SRO, present at the request of the school for the continued

maintenance of safety and order, may interview students as necessary regarding school related issues as determined

by school officials and parents will be contacted if the student is to be taken into custody or if the student is subject to

discipline for a serious offense.

**SEARCHES:** School officials have the right to search and seize property, including school property assigned to

students, when health, safety, and/or welfare of the student(s) is in jeopardy, or when there is reason to believe that a

search will turn up evidence that the student has violated school rules or the law. Searches may also include a student's

personal property such as backpacks, pockets, and other personal effects. Disrobing of a student is overly intrusive for

purposes of most student searches and is improper without express concurrence from School District counsel.

Items provided by the District for storage (e.g., lockers, desks) by students are school property and are subject to its
control and supervision. Students have no reasonable expectation of privacy in school-provided lockers, desks or other
storage areas, and may be inspected at any time with or without reason, or with or without notice, by school personnel.
The District reserves the right to monitor and inspect the student use of the District’s technology, internet and network
systems, with or without reason, or with or without notice, by school personnel.


**ARRESTS:** When a peace officer enters a campus providing a warrant or subpoena, or comes with the intent of taking a

student into custody, the peace officer will provide proper identification, and complete and sign a form required of an

arresting and/or interviewing officer for the school. The school staff shall cooperate with the officer, and may respond to

parental inquiries about the arrest. The school may explain the relinquishment of custody by the school and the location

of the student, if known, upon contact by the parent.

### Opportunity Assignment

School Board Policy | 5-306

If a child’s behavior limits or restricts his or her right to learn or inhibits or is disruptive to other students right to learn or
contributes to an unsafe environment for him, her or peers, he or she may be assigned to a transitional program such
as CUSD’s Opportunity classrooms based on the age of the student and as an alternative to long term suspension or
expulsion. Once the assignment is decided, transportation will be provided to and from the Opportunity school site. If a
student dis-enrolls from the Opportunity assigned site, and returns to CUSD, he or she will re-enter at the Opportunity
site of disenrollment.

### Student Discipline

School Board Policy | 5-306

Chandler Unified School District is dedicated to providing a safe learning environment where students can develop self-
control through positive guidance techniques.

Each school implements a systematic approach to discipline unique to its own environment and student needs. Parents
are viewed as partners in the educational process and therefore their support and involvement is essential.

**Arizona State Laws Relative to Discipline**

1. Pupils shall comply with the regulations, pursue the required course of study and submit to the authority of the
    teachers and the Governing Board. (A.R.S. § 15-841A)
2. Continued open defiance of authority, habitual profanity, vulgarity or excessive absenteeism will constitute good
    causes for expulsion. (A.R.S. § 15-341B)
3. A pupil who cuts, defaces or otherwise injures any school property may be suspended or expelled. (A.R.S. § 15-
    842A)
4. Parents or guardians of minors who have injured school property shall be liable for all damages caused by their
    children or wards. (A.R.S. § 15-842B)


### Suspensions/Expulsions

```
School Board Policy | 5-306
```
```
In the event that a student’s behavior poses a clear and immediate danger to self and/or others, the principal may
suspend a student for up to 10 days. An attempt will be made to contact the student’s parent/legal guardian. A letter
regarding the action of the school district will be sent if other contact cannot be made. Suspensions exceeding 10 days
are subject to the approval of the Superintendent. The student and parent or legal guardian will be notified of the
district’s due process procedure.
```
```
Expulsion is the permanent exclusion of a student from school and school activities, unless the Governing Board
reinstates the student's privileges to attend school. Only the Board is authorized to expel a student. The Board directs
all expulsion hearings to be conducted by a hearing officer selected from a list of hearing officers approved by the
Board. A student who has been expelled shall not be permitted on District property and shall not be permitted to
participate in District functions or activities without special permission and prior approval by the principal.
```
### Threats

```
School Board Policy | 5-305
```
```
The District is committed to providing a safe environment for all students. Please talk with your children about the
seriousness of making threats to other students or staff and understand that we must take threats seriously. If a student
threatens harm to another student or staff member, we must assume that the student intends to act on the threat.
```
```
“School districts or charter schools must expel from school for at least one year a student who is determined to have
threatened an educational institution. An expulsion requirement may be modified on a case by case basis if the pupil
participates in mediation, community service, restitution or other programs in which the pupil takes responsibility for
the results of the threat, or may reassign a pupil to an alternative education program and may require the pupil’s parent
or legal guardian to participate in mediation, community service, restitution or other programs in which the parent or
legal guardian takes responsibility with the pupil for the threat.” A.R.S. § 15-841
```
Due to the requirements of A.R.S. § 13-3620 schools and school employees are required to report criminal activity to
local law enforcement and report incidences of child abuse, neglect, and crimes against children to local law
enforcement and Child Protective Services. **The law requires schools to report threats, or rumors of threats,
against schools, students, and school personnel**. Schools must also report all incidents of non-accidental injury,
which might occur during altercations at school. (Also, see Mandatory Reporting of Criminal Activity to Law
Enforcement on page 68.)

```
Safety is a top priority at the Chandler Unified School District (CUSD). CUSD recognizes the importance of a
consistent process to use when addressing concerns about a student’s well-being. Therefore, CUSD has adopted
the evidence-based threat assessment model known as the Comprehensive School Threat Assessment Guidelines
(CSTAG). All CUSD schools have a trained threat assessment team to evaluate the risk of violence and provide a
multidisciplinary perspective. Every instance of threatening behavior will be treated seriously and examined
thoroughly under CUSD’s process to ensure a safe learning environment.
```

### Vandalism and Liability

```
School Board Policy | 3-401D
```
```
Unfortunately, occasional vandalism at our school occurs. People who damage school property will be held liable for
those damages, according to state law. In the case of minor children, their parents are liable. We ask you to help us
by teaching your child to respect public property.
```
### Weapons on Campus

```
School Board Policies | 5-305 and 5-306
```
The School Board’s policy regarding weapons on campus states that “students using, displaying or knowingly carrying,
or possessing any dangerous instrument or an item they represent as a dangerous instrument shall be suspended
from school and may be recommended for expulsion.” (See, Student Code of Conduct, page 11). It is important to
note that this policy includes weapons on campus after hours and/or on weekends and may also apply to simulated
weapons.

### Discipline Infraction Glossary

The following information shows the minimum and maximum range of disciplinary action that will be taken for each
problem area. These statements are guidelines only and do not limit the judgment of the administrator who must

### Body Worn Cameras

Increasingly, law enforcement agencies are utilizing Body Worn Cameras (BWC’s) in their law enforcement practices,
including those agencies that collaborate with the District. We have requested and been provided with information
concerning how these devices may be used. While each agency has adopted its own policy for the use of BWC’s, we
wanted to provide you with the following information below.

Generally, BWC’s will only be turned on when there is a “law enforcement action” taking place or when deemed
appropriate by the officer. BWC’s are typically NOT utilized in the following circumstances:

```
 Traditionally private settings (bathrooms, locker rooms, during medical exams, etc.) absent a compelling
reason to do so.
```
```
 When the victim of a sexual assault requests that a recording not be made.
```
```
 During casual interactions with individuals (i.e. when there is no law enforcement action), e.g., greeting and
talking to students, when teaching law related classes, and when simply being a crime deterrent presence.
 When making a recording would be impossible, impractical, or unsafe.
```
```
All law enforcement agencies must comply with A.R.S. § 1-602(9), which requires, in pertinent part, written parent
consent prior to making a video or voice recording, unless the video or voice recording is made by law enforcement
officers during or as part of a law enforcement investigation, during or as part of an interview in a criminal or child
safety services investigation or to be used solely for any of the following:
```
```
 Safety demonstrations, including the maintenance of order and discipline in the common areas of a school
or on pupil transportation vehicles;
```
```
 A purpose related to a legitimate academic or extracurricular activity;
```
```
 A purpose related to regular classroom instruction;
 Security or surveillance of buildings or grounds; or
```
```
 A photo identification card.
```

### Guidelines for Medication Administration

School Board Policies | 5-404 and 5-404A

**All medication is to be brought to school by the parent/legal guardian in a properly labeled container from the
pharmacy and/or the original unopened, over-the-counter packaging. Expired medications will NOT be
accepted. You may ask the pharmacist to label two containers: one for school and one for home. Medications
will not be sent home with students daily.**

**Medications will NOT be crushed without a licensed healthcare provider order. Parent/legal guardian is required
to provide student specific pill crusher. If a medication needs to be cut in half, it will be done by the parent/legal
guardian NOT the health assistant or nurse.**

**Any medications that the district/school nurse feels are unsafe will not be administered until licensed healthcare
provider clarification is obtained. School nurses must follow all State Scope of Practice regulations.**

**Students will NOT be allowed to carry or administer their own medication except with special written permission
from the parent/legal guardian, licensed healthcare provider, building administrator/principal, and
school/district nurse.**

**This includes prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, and natural/ herbal supplements. No controlled
substances will be allowed for self-carry for the safety of all students.**

**The parent/legal guardian is responsible for picking up the child’s medication at the end of the school year. Any
medication left over will be discarded on the last day of class. No Exceptions.**

**Parent/legal guardian is responsible for providing medications for overnight and extended day field trips with
all appropriate paperwork.**

**Prescription Medication**
 Prescription medication must be prescribed by your child’s Arizona licensed healthcare provider and filled by a
licensed pharmacy. The prescribing provider on the consent must match the medication label from the pharmacy
(exceptions may be made for providers in the same medical practice).

 Medication prescribed by out-of-state healthcare providers can be administered for up to 60 days. After 60 days, the
prescription must be replaced by a provider licensed in the State of Arizona. No Prescriptions from outside of the
United States will be accepted.

 Medications prescribed to be taken one (1) two (2) and three (3) times a day are not routinely given at school.
Exceptions may be made if the nurse discusses the need with the licensed healthcare provider and they find this is
necessary.

 A Consent for Medication Administration form must be filled out and signed by the child’s licensed healthcare
provider, and the parent/legal guardian, for prescription medication to be given.

 A new Consent for Medication Administration form must be completed and signed by the child’s licensed healthcare
provider for any changes to prescription medication (dosage, timing, etc.), including each new school year.


```
 The student is responsible for coming to the health office or to the designated person to take the medication.
 Narcotic pain medication, CBD oil and medical marijuana will not be given in the general education setting at school
for the safety of all students. (ARS§15-108)
```
**Over-the-Counter Medication**
 All Non-prescription medications will be dispensed to students upon the completion of the Consent for Medication
Administration form with parent/legal guardian signature. Medication will be given in accordance with package
directions. Dosage must be weight and age appropriate per label (i.e. children specific formula).
 If medication is to be administered for three (3) consecutive days, a licensed healthcare provider order must be
submitted to the school health office for continuing administration of the medication beyond the three (3) days to
ensure that use of this medication is not masking symptoms of a serious condition in the student.
 In order to minimize the possibility of a drug overdose, non-prescribed medications will not be dispensed during the
first and last hours of the school day.
 A new Consent for Medication Administration form is required for each school year.
 The health office does have a supply of Acetaminophen (Tylenol) in pill form that we can give to your student if they
will benefit from it and help keep them in school. For us to administer, the parent/legal guardian must give permission
during the online registration process each school year. The frequent use of Acetaminophen (Tylenol) has been
shown to cause liver problems in both children and adults; therefore, we will use Acetaminophen (Tylenol) at our
discretion. If we find we are administering Acetaminophen (Tylenol) on a recurrent basis, you may be contacted to
provide a note from your doctor along with a supply of the medication for the health office.

```

the FDA treats supplements like food. Supplements can include minerals, vitamins or other natural biological
substances and they are available in a variety of shapes and sizes, including concentrates, extracts, capsules,
tablets, liquids and powders. Because these are not regulated by the FDA, we have guidelines in place to ensure
the safety of all students.
```
```
 All Natural, Herbal and Dietary supplements will be dispensed to students upon the completion and signature of the
Consent for Medication Administration form by the parent/legal guardian.
 A new Consent for Medication Administration form is required for each school year.
```
 Supplement must be in original unopened container with all instructions intact on that container.
 If supplement is to be administered for more than three (3) consecutive days, a licensed healthcare provider’s order
may be necessary.
 Supplements will not be given the first and last hour of the school day to avoid any possibility of overdose.
 Identification of the condition for which the product is being used is necessary. That includes all safety information,
possible side effects, contraindications, and adverse reactions.


### Immunizations

```
School Board Policies | 5-403 and 5-403A
```
```
Please see health services under the department tab on the district website http://www.cusd80.com for specific information
and forms required for parents and doctors via the Arizona Department of Health Services website. If you have questions
on immunizations for your students, please contact the staff in your school health office for more information.
```
```
The Chandler CARE center at 777 E Galveston St. provides immunizations to uninsured families. Call 480-812-7900 for
more information.
```
### Emergency Card

```
School Board Policy | 5-303
```
```
Parents are required to complete a Student Emergency Health and Medical History Card for each of their children
every year. This card tells us how to contact you or another responsible adult if your child becomes ill or is injured
at school. Please list health problems including allergies to foods, medications, insect stings, etc. It is very important
to notify the office if your address, home phone number, business phone or cell phone number changes during the
school year. Please update these forms online.
```
```
The District reserves the right, in accordance with procedures established by the Superintendent, to circumscribe or
disallow the use or administration of any medication on school premises if the threat of abuse or misuse of the
medicine may pose a risk of harm to a member or members of the student population.
```
### Enforcement Mandatory Reporting of Criminal Activity to Law

```
School Board Policies | 5-204, 5-204A, and 5-204B
```
Due to the requirements of A.R.S. § 13-3620, schools and school employees are required to report criminal activity
to local law enforcement, and report incidences of child abuse, neglect, and crimes against children to local law
enforcement and Child Protective Services. Recent changes in the law require schools to report threats, or rumors
of threats against schools, students, and school personnel. Schools must also report incidents of non-accidental
injury, which might occur during altercations at school. (Also, see “Threat or Intimidation”, page 45.)

### Reporting Child Abuse

```
School Board Policies | 5-204, 5-204A, and 5-204B
```
```
Suspected child abuse is not something school employees can ignore. Apparent non-accidental injury, sexual
molestation, abuse, and neglect are required by law to be reported to Department of Child Safety and/or local law
enforcement agencies.
```

### Restricted Physical Education Activities

```
If for any reason you feel your child should have restricted physical education activities, please provide the school
health assistant with a doctor’s statement, giving the reason and the length of the restriction. This information will be
forwarded to both the classroom and physical education teacher.
```
### Toilet Training

Except for Priority Preschool classrooms, all students are required to be toilet trained before beginning preschool in
CUSD. Toilet trained is defined as the child being able to use the toilet, wipe him/herself, and pull his/her pants up
and down on their own. We understand there may be occasional accidents and request you send an extra set of
clothing to be kept at school. Children are given multiple opportunities to use the restroom throughout their preschool
day.


## TECHNOLOGY

##### Appropriate Use of Technology

```
Student Use of Personal Technology
School Board Policies 3-403 and 3-403A
```
The Governing Board intends that technological resources provided by the District be used in a safe, responsible,
and proper manner in support of the instructional program and for the advancement of student learning. The
Chandler Unified School District views the use of electronic resources as central to the delivery of its educational
program, and as such maintains the expectation that all students will use electronic resources as an essential part
of their learning experiences. It is the policy of the Chandler Unified School District to maintain an environment that
promotes ethical and responsible conduct in all electronic resource activities by staff and students.

```
Students are authorized to use District equipment and personal electronic devices to access the Internet or other
online services in accordance with Board policy, the use obligations and responsibilities specified below and outlines
in the District’s Acceptable Use Agreement.
```
```
 Students shall use the District’s system safely and for educational purposes only.
 Students shall not use the District’s electronic information services to encourage or facilitate the
use of drugs, alcohol or tobacco, or other unethical activities.
 Students are prohibited from accessing, posting, submitting, publishing or displaying harmful or
inappropriate material that is threatening, obscene, disruptive, or sexually explicit, or that could be
defined as harassment based on race/ethnicity, sex, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability,
religion, or political beliefs.
 Students shall not disclose, use, or disseminate personal identification information about
themselves or others when using email, chat rooms, or other forms of electronic communication,
unless instructed to do so by school personnel.
 Students shall not use the system to threaten, intimidate, harass, or ridicule other students or staff.
 All materials utilized for research projects should be appropriately cited as with other printed
sources of information.
 Vandalism will result in the cancellation of user privileges or more severe consequences.
 Students shall not read other users’ email or files without permission. Nor shall they attempt to read,
delete, modify, or use another’s identity electronically.
 Students shall report any security problem or misuse of the network to appropriate school
personnel.
```

```
Before a student may use district technology and/or personal electronic devices, the student and his/her parent/legal
guardian shall sign the following documents outlining the expectations and responsibilities:
```
```
 Bring Your Own Technology Responsibility Use Agreement
 Acceptable Use Agreement
```
The District reserves the right to monitor use of the District’s systems for improper use without warning or prior
consent. Students shall be informed that computer files and electronic communications, including email, are not
private and may be accessed by the District at any time. When a student violates any part of the policy, the principal
or designee may cancel or limit the student’s user privileges or increase supervision of the student’s use of
technological resources as appropriate. Inappropriate use may result in disciplinary action and/or legal action in
accordance with the law and School Board Policy.

##### Acceptable Use Agreement for the Internet

```
We are pleased to bring to the students of the Chandler School District access to electronic mail and the Internet.
Access to electronic mail and the Internet offers an abundance of resources such as thousands of libraries,
databases, and bulletin boards to both students and teachers. The district goal in providing this service is to promote
excellence in our schools by facilitating resource sharing, innovation, and communication.
```
```
Chandler School District has taken precautions to restrict access to controversial materials. However, it is impossible
to control all materials on a global network and industrious users may discover such materials. We believe that the
benefits to students to further educational goals and objectives via access to the Internet far exceed any
disadvantages. Ultimately, parents and guardians of minors are responsible for setting and conveying the standards
that their children should follow when using media and information sources. To that end, the Chandler Unified School
District supports and respects each family’s right to decide whether or not to participate.
```
```
All network activities, including Internet and E-mail, will be supervised by appropriate personnel. Below (with
explanatory examples) are activities in which your child may be a participant:
```
```
 E-mail pen-pals
```
```
 Research major news sources: (newspapers, magazines, U.S. Congress)
 File Transfer (FTP) – transfer files between computers, in either direction.
```
```
 Research (Gopher, Telnet) – research databases, card catalogs, image files, weather maps. (U.S.
Weather Service, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian)
```
```
 Conversation: Real-time e-mail-type conversation (Internet Relay Chat) or video conferencing with
distant classrooms, professional experts, technical assistance
```

##### Internet and E-mail Rules

(Terms and Conditions)

```
1) Individual users of Internet and E-mail are responsible for their behavior and communications over the Network.
The use of each user account must be in support of education and research and consistent with the educational
objectives of the Chandler Unified School District.
2) Access is a privilege – not a right. Inappropriate use will result in a cancellation of privileges. Each user who
receives access (called a “user’s account”) will be part of a discussion/training/lesson pertaining to the proper
use of the network. The network administrators will deem what is appropriate use and their decision is final. An
account may be closed at any time if inappropriate use is determined. The administration, faculty, and staff of
Chandler Unified School District may request the network administrators to deny, revoke, or suspend specific
user accounts.
3) Network etiquette:
a) Be polite, using appropriate language and pictures in your messages to others. Downloading inappropriate
materials is prohibited.
b) Respect and maintain user privacy. Do not reveal any names, home addresses, or phone numbers.
c) Assume that all communication and information accessible through the network are private property.
Copyright infringement is prohibited.
d) Use the network appropriately in such a way that would not disrupt the use of the network by others.
e) Damaging computers, computer systems or computer networks is prohibited and will not be tolerated.
```
```
4) Personal responsibility: Report any misuse of the information service to a parent, teacher, or the system
administrator, as appropriate.
```
By using the District's network, you acknowledge and understand that many services and products are available for a
fee and _acknowledge the responsibility for any expenses incurred without District authorization._

###### VIOLATIONS OF THE ABOVE NETWORK ETIQUETTE MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF ACCESS AS WELL AS

###### OTHER DISCIPLINARY ACTION.


##### BYOT Responsible Use Agreement

School Board Policies | 1-202, 3-403, and 3-403A

We are pleased to be able to offer “Bring Your Own Technology” as an option to expand student and staff access to
online and other educational electronic resources. The purpose of this agreement is to outline the expectations for use

of personal electronic devices on our campuses.

**Chandler Unified School District BYOT Philosophy**
Our philosophy is to assist all members of the Chandler Unified School District community to be **good digital citizens** –

students and staff who use technology to support learning in a meaningful, safe and responsible way, in accordance with

all applicable state and federal laws. (NOTE: Regulations, consequences, and possible disciplinary action for

inappropriate use of the network and electronic devices are already covered by the CUSD Acceptable Use Policy, a

separate document available at: [http://cusd80.com/AUP.)](http://cusd80.com/AUP.))

**Purpose of and Permissions to Use Personal Electronic Devices at School**
Like other personal items that may be brought from home to school, there are times and places where the use of personal

electronic devices is beneficial to instruction, and other times when it is not. The expectation is that personal electronic

devices are to be used only for instructional purposes, in appropriate times and places as determined by each school’s

principal. Teachers who permit the use of personal electronic devices in class are expected to model and teach

responsible use of the Internet, to monitor students’ use of the devices, and to set up any applicable classroom procedures

and rules pertaining to this use. Teachers or other staff may be able to assist but cannot be expected to troubleshoot
problems with the students’ technology.

**Internet and Network Access**
We maintain a filter that blocks harmful content on the Internet from students. When you sign this agreement and bring in

your own device, you will be allowed to use the district-supplied, filtered network for Internet access at your school, if

available. **The District reserves the right to monitor use of the District's systems for improper use without advance**

**notice or consent.** Your signature indicates your understanding that any activity that occurs with the use of the District’s

internet and network systems are not private and may be accessed by the District for the purpose of ensuring proper use.

Your signature also indicates your understanding that we cannot filter any non-district network connections (such as 3G or
4G) that may be already present on your device, and that you agree to follow the Acceptable Use Policy and all other

related CUSD policies related to Internet use, regardless of the network you use. Use of electronic devices outside of

these conditions is not allowed, can be considered a distraction to instruction, and will be handled as already described in

the Student Handbook. (Please see below for more information about current policies related to technology use at school.)


**Examples of What You MAY Do with Your Device at School:**
_Using the device at times and in places when the teacher has given permission for you to use them, such as:_

```
 Conducting research on the web for a school project – citing resources, following copyright law, respecting the
intellectual property of others.
 Creating documents in collaboration with other students when working in groups.
 Participating in class discussion threads, using respectful language to others.
 Engaging in class activities using your device as a responder.
 Taking a photo or video of a project to put into a class presentation.
```
**Examples of What You MAY NOT Do with Your Device at School:**
_Using the device at times or in places when the teacher has asked you not to use them, such as, but not limited to:_

 (^) Texting to others for non-instructional purposes.
 Bullying or threatening others.
 Playing non-educational games.
 Attempting to bypass network security or engaging in hacking.
 Taking a photo or video of another person and posting it to the Internet.
 Sharing personal information with others.
 Engaging in plagiarism or copyright infringement.
Please note that use of personal electronic devices is left to the discretion of the classroom teacher. The teacher will make
the final determination of when use of personal electronic devices is appropriate.
**You are encouraged to:**
 Personalize your device with a case, school-appropriate skins, decals, wallpaper, etc. that will make it easier to
distinguish your device from other students’ similar devices.
 Charge your device before bringing it to school. (It will not be possible to charge student devices at school.)
 Keep track of your personal electronic device. The school and District are not liable for your losses due to theft,
damage, or other financial harm.
 Follow the Acceptable Use Policy and school and class rules. Remember that BYOT is a privilege, not a right.
This privilege can be taken away if abused.
 Install, update, and use virus protection on your device. If your device is determined to be the source of virus
infections or security problems, access may be discontinued.
As new technology becomes available, we expect that it will be necessary to update this document and to make
clarifications. If you have questions about which devices and specific uses are permitted, please refer these questions to
your teacher and/or school principal.


##### Technology Resources

**(Movies/Videos/Electronic Materials)**
School Board Policy | 5-208

Movies, videos and electronic materials with ratings other than for general audiences of all ages are not to be shown in
classrooms or at any District facility (this includes buses and motels where students are present) except when all of the
following have occurred:

```
 The movie, video or electronic material has been previewed by the teacher or other certificated staff member.
 The movie, video or electronic material has been determined to not contain material that is objectionable or
inappropriate for the age group to which it is intended to be shown.
 The responsible school administrator has approved of the use of the movie, video or electronic material prior to
its showing.
 The teacher or other certificated staff member has provided advance notification to each student's parent(s), or
other responsible adult, of the title of the movie, video or electronic material and the date on which it will be
shown.
```
When a movie, video or electronic material has a rating, the above advance notification will include the rating and the
source providing the rating.

A student whose parent(s) or other responsible adult has provided notice of their disapproval will not be permitted to view
the movie, video or electronic material.

Parents have the right to request that their child not view any movie or video, regardless of its rating or the purpose for
which it is to be shown.

A parent or legal guardian who objects to any learning material or activity on the basis that it is harmful (including because
it questions beliefs or practices in sex, morality, or religion or, because of sexual content, violent content, or profane or
vulgar language) may request to withdraw that student from the activity or from the class or program in which the material
is used and request an alternative assignment.

_Please reference School Board Policy 5-208._


##### Lightspeed Alert

As part of our efforts to maintain a safe, secure online experience for students, Chandler Unified School District uses a
technology tool known as Lightspeed Alert in grades K-12. This scanning program reviews students’ cloud storage files
(Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.) and web searches made using their CUSD account and/or device for inappropriate images
and /or content identified by keywords. Alert will flag content referencing intentions of violence, drug and alcohol use, sex,
self-harm, hate speech, pornography, etc. It will also analyze images to block pornography and obscene visuals from
reaching students.

Alert representatives review students’ cloud storage files throughout the day and night and send alerts to administrators at
the school and the district office. School administrators will contact parents/legal guardians when an alert is received. If a
parent/legal guardian cannot be reached, administrators will contact local law enforcement to request a well-check on
students of alerts regarding threats of self-harm.

All school rules apply to the content on a student’s cloud storage drive and email inbox. Students are encouraged to practice
responsible digital citizenship.

We look forward to continuing to collaborate with families to support and meet our students’ needs and to protect them while
in our care.

Thank you,
CUSD District Administration


#### TRANSPORTATION POLICY

##### Transportation

School Board Policy | 3-302

The primary purpose of the District’s Transportation Department is to safely transport students to and from school. It takes
shared cooperation and responsible actions by the bus driver, student, parent, teacher, school administrator, and the
Transportation Department to achieve this goal. The District’s Transportation Department staff commits to provide the
safest buses and best-trained drivers that our resources allow. Our drivers are required to meet training standards that
exceed the requirements established by state and federal regulations. We rely on all of the students (supported by their
parents or guardians) to follow procedures that contribute to the safety of everyone on the bus. Parents are responsible
to ensure their children’s safety prior to the arrival of the bus at the stop in the morning and on the way home from the
stop in the afternoon.

**Kindergarten and First Grade Students**
Our bus drivers will only drop K-1st bus riders off at their designated bus stop with an older sibling student or if an adult
is waiting at the location. If either option is not available, the bus driver will notify Transportation Dispatch. Dispatch will
try to contact student’s parent. If unable to make contact, then student will be returned to their home school.

**Instruments on the Bus**
Because space on our buses is limited, we cannot guarantee that students will be able to transport large band or orchestra
instruments on the bus.

**When Walking isn’t Allowed**
Occasionally, a parent may request that a student regularly walk or ride a bike to school using a path that involves crossing
a major roadway with no crossing guard. If the District provides busing from a particular area, it is because it has deemed
it too far or unsafe for a student to walk and the district will not allow a student to walk or ride a bike from that area.

Please ensure that you and your children have reviewed the bus rules and consequences listed on pages 78-79**.**


##### Safe Student Transportation

##### Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)

**Notice for Directory Information**

The _Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act_ (FERPA), a Federal law, requires that Chandler Unified School District
(CUSD), with certain exceptions, obtain your written consent prior to the disclosure of personally identifiable
information from your child’s education records. However, CUSD may disclose appropriately designated “directory
information” without written consent, unless you have advised the District to the contrary in accordance with District
procedures. The primary purpose of directory information is to allow CUSD to include this type of information from
your child’s education records in certain school publications. Examples include:
 A playbill, showing your student’s role in a drama production;
 The annual yearbook;
 Honor roll or other recognition lists;
 Graduation programs; and
 Sports activity sheets, such as for wrestling, showing weight and height of team members.

Directory information, which is information that is generally not considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if
released, can also be disclosed to outside organizations without a parent’s prior written consent. Outside
organizations include, but are not limited to, companies that manufacture class rings or publish yearbooks. In
addition, two federal laws require local educational agencies (LEAs) receiving assistance under the _Elementary and
Secondary Education Act of 1965_ (ESEA) to provide military recruiters, upon request, with three directory information
categories – names, addresses and telephone listings – unless parents have advised the LEA that they do not want
their student’s information disclosed without their prior written consent. 1

If you do not want CUSD to disclose directory information from your child’s education records without your prior written
consent, you must notify the District in writing within two weeks of the start of school. CUSD has designated the
following information as directory information:

**- Student’s name - Date and place of birth
- Student’s current school name - Major field of study
- Parent/Legal guardian’s name - Dates of attendance
- SAIS/Student ID number - Grade level
- Address - Participation in officially recognized activities and sports
- Telephone listing - Weight and height of members of athletic teams
- Electronic mail address - Degrees, honors, and awards received
- Photograph - The most recent educational agency or institution attended**

1 These laws are: Section 9528 of the ESEA (20 U.S.C. 7908), as amended by the _No Child Left Behind Act of 2001_ (P.L. 107-110), the
education bill, and 10 U.S.C. 503, as amended by section 544, the _National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002_ (P.L. 107-107),
the legislation that provides funding for the Nation’s armed forces.


##### Notification of Rights under FERPA

**For Elementary Schools**

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) afford parents and students over 18 years of age ("eligible
students") certain rights with respect to the student's education records. These rights are:

(1) The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the School receives a
request for access.

Parents or eligible students should submit to the School principal [or appropriate school official] a written request
that identifies the record(s) they wish to inspect. The School official will make arrangements for access and notify the
parent or eligible student of the time and place where the records may be inspected.

(2) The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the parent or eligible student believes
is inaccurate.

Parents or eligible students may ask the School to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate. They should write
the School principal [or appropriate school official], clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify
why it is inaccurate. If the School decides not to amend the record as requested by the parent or eligible student, the
School will notify the parent or eligible student of the decision and advise them of their right to a hearing regarding the
request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the parent or eligible
student when notified of the right to a hearing.

(3) The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education
records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.

One exception, which permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational
interests. A school official is a person employed by the School as an administrator, supervisor, instructor, or support staff
member (including health or medical staff and law enforcement unit personnel); a person serving on the School Board;
a person or company with whom the School has contracted to perform a special task (such as an attorney, auditor,
medical consultant, or therapist); or a parent or student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or
grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks.

A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to
fulfill his or her professional responsibility.

Upon request, the School discloses education records without consent to officials of another school district in which
a student seeks or intends to enroll

(4) The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the Chandler
Unified School District to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers

**Notification of Rights under the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA)**

PPRA affords parents certain rights regarding our conduct of surveys, collection and use of information for marketing purposes, and certain
physical exams. These include the right to:

 Consent before students are required to submit to a survey that concerns one or more of the following protected areas (“protected information
survey”) if the survey is funded in whole or in part by a program of the U.S. Department of Education (ED)–

1. Political affiliations or beliefs of the student or student’s parent;
2. Mental or psychological problems of the student or student’s family;
3. Sex behavior or attitudes;
4. Illegal, anti-social, self-incriminating, or demeaning behavior;
5. Critical appraisals of others with whom respondents have close family relationships;
6. Legally recognized privileged relationships, such as with lawyers, doctors, or ministers;
7. Religious practices, affiliations, or beliefs of the student or parents; or
8. Income, other than as required by law to determine program eligibility.
 Receive notice and an opportunity to opt a student out of –
1. Any other protected information survey, regardless of funding;
2. Any non-emergency, invasive physical exam or screening required as a condition of attendance, administered by the school or its agent,
and not necessary to protect the immediate health and safety of a student, except for hearing, vision, or scoliosis screenings, or any
physical exam or screening permitted or required under State law; and
3. Activities involving collection, disclosure, or use of personal information obtained from students for marketing or to sell or otherwise

3. Instructional material used as part of the educational curriculum.

These rights transfer from the parents to a student who is 18 years old or an emancipated minor under State law.

Chandler Unified School District (CUSD) has developed and adopted policies, in consultation with parents, regarding these rights, as well as
arrangements to protect student privacy in the administration of protected information surveys and the collection, disclosure, or use of personal
information for marketing, sales, or other distribution purposes. CUSD will directly notify parents of these policies at least annually at the start of
each school year and after any substantive changes. CUSD will also directly notify, such as through U.S. Mail or email, parents of students who
are scheduled to participate in the specific activities or surveys noted below and will provide an opportunity for the parent to opt his or her child
out of participation of the specific activity or survey. CUSD will make this notification to parents at the beginning of the school year if the District
has identified the specific or approximate dates of the activities or surveys at that time. For surveys and activities scheduled after the school year
starts, parents will be provided reasonable notification of the planned activities and surveys listed below and will be provided an opportunity to opt
their child out of such activities and surveys. Parents will also be provided an opportunity to review any pertinent surveys. Following is a list of
the specific activities and surveys covered under this requirement:

```
 Collection, disclosure, or use of personal information for marketing, sales or other distribution.
 Administration of any protected information survey not funded in whole or in part by ED.
 Any non-emergency, invasive physical examination or screening as described above.

#### PRESCHOOL ADDENDUM

##### Program Philosophy

Chandler Unified School District’s Early Childhood programing is based on the belief that children learn through
experience and discovery. With the understanding that every child is unique, our early childhood programs are organized
to initiate activities to grow from personal interest and intention using hands-on developmentally appropriate materials.
Through the use of developmentally appropriate curriculum, the social, emotional, physical, and cognitive needs of all our
students are developed.

##### Program Descriptions

**Preschool**
Preschool programming is designed with our youngest learners in mind. Three-year-old’s will receive instruction in English
Language Arts, Mathematics, Science and Social Sciences, Art, and more! They will also experience a variety of
opportunities meant to support social development, including peer and adult interaction. **Students must be three (3) by
August 31 and independent in self-care skills, including toileting.**

**Pre-Kindergarten**
Pre-Kindergarten programming provides a rigorous pre-academic curriculum with an emphasis on preparing students for
Kindergarten. Four-year-old’s will receive instruction in English Language Arts, Mathematics, Science and Social
Sciences, Art, and more! They will also experience a variety of opportunities meant to support social development,
including peer and adult interaction. **Students must be four (4) by August 31 and independent in self-care skills,
including toileting.**

**DLE Pre-Kindergarten**
Our new Dual Language Exploration (DLE) program offers four-year-old children an opportunity to experience Language
exposure which leads into our successful Dual Language Immersion programs. The Spanish DLE program experience
will be offered at Chandler Traditional Academy – Freedom Campus and Chandler Traditional Academy - Liberty Campus.
The Mandarin DLE program experience will be offered at Tarwater Elementary.

**Title I Pre-Kindergarten**
Title I Pre-Kindergarten programs are funded through Federal and State funds and are free to Chandler residents who
live within the Title I school boundaries. Title I programs provide a rigorous academic curriculum with an emphasis on
preparing students for Kindergarten. Four-year-old’s will receive instruction in English Language Arts, Mathematics,
Science and Social Sciences, Art, and more! They will also experience a variety of opportunities meant to support social
development, including peer and adult interaction. **Students must be four (4) by August 31 and independent in self-
care skills, including toileting.**


**Special Education Services for Preschool and Pre-Kindergarten**
School Board Policy 5-102 and 5-103

Special education services are provided for children ages 3 to 5 (not of kindergarten age as of September 1st deadline) who
meet eligibility requirements. Individual educational programming is designed to meet the unique needs of the child.

To be eligible as an early childhood special education student, the child must have a comprehensive evaluation and meet
eligibility guidelines as a child with a disability. Typically, the child is referred to our school district by an outside agency,
medical provider, or the parent. A screening process will determine if a child should be referred for further evaluation. If so,
a full evaluation will be conducted to determine whether the child is eligible for special education services. If eligible, an
Individualized Education Program (IEP) will be developed by the school district team and parents to meet the child’s needs.
Eligible children are offered services to meet their needs free of charge and are not required to be independent with self-care
skills, including toileting.

##### General Information

**Classroom Visits**
Parents are encouraged to observe and volunteer in the classroom. This also provides the teacher with help and
support as the students learn, play, clean up or transition between activities. Talk to your child's teacher about specific
volunteer schedules.

**Communication**
To ensure a successful early learning experience, it is important to have good communication between school and home.
Newsletters are sent home to help keep parents informed about their child’s program as well as special events that are
planned throughout the school year. We encourage parents to visit the school’s website to view information that is posted
on the early childhood teacher’s webpage.

**Dress Code**
School Board Policy 5-302

Simple play clothes are appropriate for early childhood students. Children interact with paints, markers, glitter, and glue,
and there may be spills at snack time. Children also are running, jumping, and climbing during free play time. Good
supportive shoes should be worn daily. Most playgrounds are covered with wood chips that can injure children’s feet if
sandals are worn. Socks and tennis shoes are always the best footwear for early learners. Some sites may require a
dress code.

**Early Childhood Orientation/Curriculum Night**
This is an opportunity to learn more about our school and your child’s classroom. Information about your child's early
childhood program and curriculum will be shared at this event.

**Hygiene**
To keep all our children healthy, students are required to wash their hand on arrival, before and after snack time, after
recess, and after water play. Hand washing prevents the spread of germs and becomes a lifelong habit. We appreciate
your help in reinforcing this routine at home as well.


**Late Pick Up – Community Education Programs**
We understand that emergencies do occur. However, our procedure for late pick up is as follows:
 $1.00 per minute, per child after the end of the scheduled class time.

If you are going to be late, please first contact your child’s teacher. If you cannot reach the teacher, please contact the
school’s attendance technician. If you are going to be more than 20 minutes late, please ask someone else on your pick-
up list to come for your child. Late fees will be applied regardless of who is picking up should the pickup extend beyond
dismissal.

If you call before arriving late, you and the staff will be able to work out the details prior to your arrival. The late pick-up
fee will be posted to your Community Education account and payment will be processed with the card you have on file in
your Community Education account.

If you fail to pick up your child/ren at the scheduled pick up time without notice, or arrange for someone else to pick them

up, the site will make two attempts to contact you. If we are unable to contact a parent/legal guardian, we will contact the
emergency person(s) listed on your child’s emergency form to advise them that your child remains in our care without

notice from you. If, for any reason, there is no telephone service we will contact the police to request assistance in

contacting a parent/legal guardian or emergency contact person.

The school site agrees to keep your child for one hour after the stated pickup time, with late fees accruing, before

contacting the local police, if contact cannot be made with a parent/legal guardian or emergency contact person. We

agree to not discuss your tardiness in arriving with your child beyond reassuring them that you or someone they know will
be there soon to pick them up.

The parent/legal guardian agrees to advise the preschool teacher immediately of any changes regarding their personal
contact information, to include address and phone numbers, for home, work, and cell phones. Parent/legal guardian also
agrees to provide immediate notice to the preschool teacher of any changes in emergency contacts or contingency
routines.

**Meet the Teacher**
Parents and students will have the opportunity to visit the classroom before school is in session. This event helps to
ensure a smooth transition on the first day of school.

**Parent/Teacher Conferences**

Parent-teacher conferences take place two times during the school year. They are scheduled in August and February. These
conferences provide an opportunity to discuss your child’s progress and work together to help them be successful. Parent-
teacher conferences give parents the chance to ask questions about their child’s progress and discuss any concerns they
may have.


**Portfolios**
A portfolio is a collection of work that is kept on file for each Early Childhood student throughout the school year. The
portfolio includes writing samples, cutting samples, art projects, and other evidence of the child’s work. Portfolios are
shared with parents during conferences to demonstrate the growth each child has achieved in certain skill areas.

**Progress Monitoring**
Teaching Strategies GOLD is an observational tool that monitors performance and progress. This assessment tool allows
us to assess the children in different classroom activities by observing and recording early childhood students at work
and at play. It is a way for teachers to evaluate kindergarten readiness. This information indicates how your child is
progressing in the program, and how we can better provide support that will help them develop the skills needed to be
successful in Kindergarten.

**Teacher Qualifications**
School Board Policy 4-101

All early childhood classes are taught by certified teachers and staffed with a para-educator. The goal is to maintain class
size at 20 students with a 1:10 adult to student Ration. Additional para-educator support is provided when required.

**Toilet Training**
Except for students eligible for Special Education, all students are required to be toilet trained before beginning an early
childhood program in CUSD. Toilet trained is defined as the child being able to use the toilet, wipe him/herself, and pull
his/her pants up and down on their own. We understand there may be occasional accidents and request you send an
extra set of clothing to be kept at school. Children are given multiple opportunities to use the restroom throughout their
school day.

Students being potty-trained includes the following:
 Students should be able to **communicate** their need to go to the bathroom prior to going potty. If necessary, the
student’s communication should be such that allows for time to accommodate any necessary waiting for the
bathroom or travel to and from the restrooms.
 Students should be able to **independently manage** their clothing both before and after going to the bathroom
(pull up and down their pants and underwear).
 Students should be able to **independently handle** the appropriate hygiene associated with going to the bathroom
(appropriate wiping, cleaning/drying hands, etc.).
 The use of pull-ups **is not** permitted as an alternative.

##### Program Services

**Screening and Referral Process**
School Board Policies | 5-102B and 5-102C

A screening tool is used to screen children’s abilities within the first 45 days of attendance. This screening tool
encompasses vision, hearing, communication, social/emotional/behavioral, sensory, motor, and adaptive skills. If there are
developmental concerns, the teacher will provide parents/legal guardians with contact information to the CUSD Child Find
Assessment Center to determine if your child has a potential disability requiring further evaluation. If you have any
questions regarding the screening process, please call the Child Find Assessment Center at 480-883-5865.

Spalding utilizes a structed approach to literacy by focusing on principles such as phonemic awareness, systematic phonics
instruction, decoding, morphology, fluency, and comprehension. At its core, Spalding introduces students to the most
fundamental pieces of the language by breaking words into phonograms. Additionally, Spalding integrates direct instruction
in speaking and listening, spelling, writing, and reading. The Spalding mission is to develop skilled readers, critical listeners
